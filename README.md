# PyCLES_CUDA

Old repository of Particle Tracers that shows the use of CUDA with PyCLES.

The notebook (Manual.ipynb) includes all the necessary steps for installation, compilation, run, and a small tutorial.

I had a great time working on this project (28 December 2014), it was the first time I delivered something in Python and CUDA.

As you can see it's recommended to use a clean python(no macports nor homebrew). 

The package manager can be used to install libraries that involve gcc (open-mpi or hdf5).

I had some hard time updating my libraries with Yosemite.

Finally, I decided to uninstall macports and get some homebrew flavor.
